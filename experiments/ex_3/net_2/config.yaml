# General Parameters
checkpoint:             # set the checkpoint from where to continue, leave empty to start from scratch
log_name: ex3_net2.log  # name of the file with training info
gpu:                    # index of a GPU, if available
output_directory: experiments/ex_3/net_2  # the directory where to write the model file
parallel: false

model_path: "{}/{}_{}_{}.pth" #for those which use pretrained models

# Data Parameters
data:
  dataset_path: /local/scratch/kuebler/ 
  dataset: emnist    # MNIST and EMNIST path

# Common parameters
seed: 42        # Common seed across all source of randomness
batch_size: 32  # If distributed training the batch size is multiplied by the number of gpus
epochs: 50    # Number of epochs to train.
workers: 0      # Dataloader number of workers
patience: 0    # Number of epochs to wait before stopping the training. 0 means no early stopping
