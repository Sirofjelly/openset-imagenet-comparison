gpu:                    # index of a GPU, if available
output_directory: experiments/ex_4/net_2  # the directory where to write the model file
parallel: false

model_path: "{}/{}_{}_{}.pth" #for those which use pretrained models

# Data Parameters
data:

  dataset: emnist    # MNIST and EMNIST path

# Common parameters
seed: 42        # Common seed across all source of randomness
batch_size: 32  # If distributed training the batch size is multiplied by the number of gpus
epochs: 50    # Number of epochs to train.
workers: 0      # Dataloader number of workers
